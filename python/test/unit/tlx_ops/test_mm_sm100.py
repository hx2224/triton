"""sm100 L1 correctness for ``tlx.ops.mm``.

Runs the hardware-agnostic synthetic list plus every MM focus suite. L2 perf
selects only the running host's configured default.

A shape the op declines is reported as a skip with the reason, never as a
pass.

TODO: cover the config variants dropped with the tutorial copy of this kernel --
USE_WARP_BARRIER and NUM_CTAS=2. Only the heuristic-selected config runs today.

The split-K tests include white-box workspace-layout coverage because the
public API cannot pin ``SPLIT_K``/``NUM_CTAS``. A split's region must cover the
whole padded tile grid; otherwise an epilogue tile can overwrite the next
split's partials.
