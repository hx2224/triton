"""Perf guardrail for `tlx.ops.kimi_delta_attention`. No reference.

The only KDA reference in the tree is the per-chunk python loop in
`test_kimi_delta_attention.py`, which does a `solve_triangular` per chunk and
cannot be timed. So there is no `speedup` column, and the perf gate is the
absolute `FLOOR_TFLOPS` -- currently None, i.e. this op reports rather than
gates until a clean run exists to seed the floor from.

TODO: `fla` (flash-linear-attention) ships `chunk_kda`, which would be a real
reference. It is not a dependency of this suite and the README promises torch
and triton only, so adding it means an optional import that skips the reference
when absent -- deliberately deferred rather than done quietly.
