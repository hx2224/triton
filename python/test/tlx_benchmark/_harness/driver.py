"""The part of a benchmark that is the same for every op.

`bench_<op>.py` supplies what only it can know -- the shapes, how to build the
operands, what to race against, how many FLOPs that is -- and nothing else.
Device selection, clock governing, the cold-compile pass, the measurement
window, the verdict, the table and the artifact all live here, so adding an op
does not mean copying a CLI.

The adapter is the bench module itself, duck-typed, because `test_ops_perf.py`
already discovers and calls bench modules that way. Six names:

    OP              str                       -- catalog op name
    REF_NAME        str                       -- what `ref_fn` is; lands in env["ref"]
    EXTRA_COLUMNS   ((header, key), ...)      -- which Result.extra keys get a column
    SHAPE_SUITES    FocusRegistry | None      -- focus-suite selection and validation
    cases(synthetic, suites)    -> list[Case]
    prepare(case, space)        -> Prepared

and one line of wiring:

    supported, default_json, run, main = driver.bind(sys.modules[__name__])
