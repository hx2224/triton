# TLX Kernel Optimization Agent

This directory contains the TLX-local optimization system for standalone Triton and TLX
kernels. Its implementation has two runtime components and one deterministic self-check
suite:

- `optimizer/` is the only autonomous, Codex-backed component. It interprets measured
  evidence and proposes config, kernel, or compiler work.
- `decision_maker/` owns authoritative evaluation, budgets, run state, promotion, stopping,
  persistence, and VCS finalization.
- `self_check/` contains deterministic regression tests. It is not an agent.

The root package contains shared contracts and public exports; implementation lives in the
three directories above.

The language used by the kernel is not part of the control-plane contract. A
user-supplied harness owns compilation, correctness, timing, and profiling.

The loop is:

```text
build -> verify -> benchmark -> profile -> propose source mutation -> repeat
```

Production `tlx.ops` tuning is a two-phase specialization
of that same loop. The first phase edits only the full search-space constructor;
the second freezes that oracle and edits only `heuristic_config`. The Decision
Maker requires one heuristic config, at least 98% weighted geometric-mean parity
with full, and at least 95% parity on every stable production shape.

The Decision Maker establishes the authoritative baseline and supplies normalized evidence
to the Optimizer.

The candidate generator can propose source, but it cannot declare a candidate correct or
faster. A candidate is promoted only when every protected case passes and the weighted
geometric-mean speedup and measurement-variance thresholds are met. Failed unprotected
cases are retained as diagnostics and excluded from the aggregate speedup.

Every optimizer submission declares an `experiment_kind`, its `change_scopes`, and a
`blast_radius`. Only `promotable` submissions can update the winner or reach VCS. PTX,
AMDGCN, and IR-override ablations are evaluated as isolated experiments and recorded as
signals; a measured signal must be converted into a later promotable implementation.
`human_review` stops autonomous execution before candidate evaluation. Compiler-scoped or
non-local promotable submissions are also escalated instead of being applied automatically.

## Harness contract

A harness is a Python file with these functions:

```python
def build(kernel_source: str, target: dict): ...
def build_experiment(kernel_source: str, target: dict, experiment: dict): ...  # optional
def verify(build_artifact, case: dict) -> bool | dict: ...
def benchmark(build_artifact, case: dict, repetitions: int) -> list[float] | dict: ...
def profile(build_artifact, case: dict) -> dict: ...  # optional
```

`build` may return an arbitrary in-process artifact. Returning a mapping with `success`,
`artifact`, and `diagnostics` fields makes build failure explicit. `verify` returns either
a bool or `{passed, diagnostics, metrics}`. `benchmark` returns microsecond samples or
`{samples_us, warmup_count, cache_policy}`. `profile` is optional; when present it is
called after a successful `verify` + `benchmark` pair and its return value (a JSON object)
is persisted per case.

`build_experiment` is required only when a target opts into `ptx_ablation`,
`amdgcn_ablation`, or `ir_override`. It receives the declared kind, scopes, blast radius,
and harness-specific payload. The remaining verification, benchmark, and profile steps use
the normal authoritative harness path.

The default harness mode is **subprocess isolation** (`decision_maker/runner.py` subprocess per candidate):
candidate state and imported kernel modules never leak across evaluations. An in-process
`StandaloneHarness` is available programmatically (via `from third_party.tlx.tools.agents.kernel_optimization.decision_maker.harness import StandaloneHarness`)
for debugging and unit tests.

Build/verify/benchmark/profile run in a new subprocess for every source candidate via
`decision_maker/runner.py`. On timeout the Decision Maker sends `SIGTERM` then `SIGKILL` to the whole process
group. Large profile payloads (>1MB inline JSON) are spilled to
`artifacts/profile_traces/` with a pointer left in `experiments/<id>/profile.json`.

## CLI

TLX-agent exposes two tasks:

- `authoring`: optimize kernel implementation source against its target harness.
- `tuning`: expand a production configuration space and distill its full-space
  winners into a heuristic dispatch policy.

Run standalone authoring from the Triton source repository root:

```bash
python -m third_party.tlx.tools.agents.kernel_optimization.decision_maker.cli \
  --task authoring \
  --kernel my_kernel.py --reference-kernel reference_kernel.py \
  --output-dir /tmp/tlx-kernel-agent-run \
  --max-rounds 5 \
  --provider codex --arch blackwell

# Continue from a completed run without adopting its winner:
python -m third_party.tlx.tools.agents.kernel_optimization.decision_maker.cli \
  --task authoring \
  --kernel my_kernel.py --output-dir /tmp/tlx-kernel-agent-next \
  --prior-run /tmp/tlx-kernel-agent-run \
  --provider codex --arch blackwell

# A revalidated winner is committed by default:
python -m third_party.tlx.tools.agents.kernel_optimization.decision_maker.cli \
  --task authoring \
  --kernel my_kernel.py --output-dir /tmp/tlx-kernel-agent-run \
  --vcs auto \
  --commit-message "Optimize my kernel with TLX agent"
```

Run standalone tuning for a production MM configuration space and heuristic
policy. The kernel path is
inferred as `third_party/tlx/ops/kernels/<op>/<arch>.py`, and cases are loaded
directly from the named production suite so updates are picked up automatically:

```bash
python -m third_party.tlx.tools.agents.kernel_optimization.decision_maker.cli \
  --task tuning --op mm --arch gfx942 --suite gfx942_all
```

`--task tuning` is inferred when `--op` or `--suite` is present, but the examples
spell it explicitly. `authoring` is inferred otherwise.
The former `--objective kernel|heuristic-policy` spelling is deprecated and
accepted only as a compatibility alias.

The tuning task selects the least-used GPU matching `--arch`, sets its
visibility before PyTorch initializes, applies the benchmark clock/power
governor, and binds the process to the GPU-local NUMA node. Use `--device N` to
pin a physical GPU, `--no-govern` for an intentionally ungoverned run, or
`--no-commit-winner` for artifact-only execution. Artifacts default to
`/tmp/tlx-agent-<arch>-<op>-<suite>`.

MM tuning is operation-level rather than architecture-specific. It executes
candidate implementations through `tlx.ops.mm`, while the selected device
chooses the architecture implementation. An implementation is ready for this
task when it exposes `space="full"`, `space="heuristic"`, a full-space factory,
and `heuristic_config`. The tuning task requires at least 16 candidates in the
full space; when the incumbent is smaller, its first phase asks the agent to
expand it before deriving the heuristic.

The output contains separate `search_space/` and `heuristic/` agent runs plus a
top-level `best_kernel.py`, compact `summary.json`, and complete `result.json`.
Search-space candidates may change only the implementation's detected
full-space factory; heuristic candidates may change only `heuristic_config`.
Each heuristic branch must carry a one-sentence explanation. Use
`--search-rounds` and `--heuristic-rounds` to budget the phases independently.

`tuning` is also available as the epilogue of `authoring`. Supplying the
production operation and suite makes the successful authored source—not merely
the on-disk source—the input to tuning:

```bash
python -m third_party.tlx.tools.agents.kernel_optimization.decision_maker.cli \
  --task authoring \
  --op mm --arch gfx942 --suite gfx942_all \
  --output-dir /tmp/tlx-agent-gfx942-mm-authoring
```

The epilogue writes its artifacts under `<output-dir>/tuning/`; the combined
task result is `<output-dir>/task_result.json`. If authoring does not pass its
gates, tuning is not run.

`--arch` and `--target-name` select a manifest-backed bundle under
`decision_maker/targets/<vendor>/<arch>/<target-name>`. `--target-name` defaults to the
kernel filename stem; use it when an implementation-specific filename such as
`amd_gemm_warp_pipeline.py` should use the generic `gemm` target contract. `harness`,
`cases`, and `target` can also be passed explicitly.

`--prior-run` accepts a completed output directory or its `experiments.json`. It
imports recomputed source hashes for exact cross-run deduplication and bounded,
sanitized experiment evidence for candidate prompts. It never mutates prior
artifacts or adopts the prior winner; the current kernel is always rebuilt and
validated as the new baseline.

`--reference-kernel` is optional: a trusted oracle kernel. When provided it is persisted to `reference_kernel.py` in the output dir, exposed to harness workers via `TLX_REFERENCE_KERNEL_PATH`, and shown (truncated) to Codex in the prompt as comparison context. `verify` may load it to compare candidate vs reference.

`--provider` is `codex` (default, shells `codex exec`) or `mock` (deterministic stub for
CI that replays canned candidates or echoes the current source). When `codex` is not
installed the provider fails fast with a clear error suggesting `--provider mock`.

Promotion checkpoint commits are enabled by default. Every candidate that passes the
promotion gates is committed immediately before the next candidate is generated. Use
`--no-commit-winner` for artifact-only runs. The CLI
finds the repository from the absolute kernel path and supports `--vcs auto|git|hg` without
using `sl`. Every promoted-candidate commit includes the body line `TLX agent authored`.
Existing unrelated staged and dirty work is preserved. If the target was already dirty, only
the Agent delta is committed and the original target edits remain unstaged/dirty; overlapping
edits fail safely. If final revalidation fails after promotions, the Agent creates a forward
rollback commit without the winner attribution and keeps the checkpoint commits in history.
Exit code `3` means a promotion or rollback commit failed. Ordered commit metadata is written
to `promotion_commits.json`; the compatibility summary remains in `auto_commit.json`.
Exit code `4` means autonomous execution stopped for human review.

The optimizer reports baseline, every candidate, and final revalidation performance
to stderr as soon as each evaluation completes. Each line includes status, aggregate
speedup, and per-case correctness, median, p95, CV, and speedup. Each try also logs a
bounded hypothesis/change/expected-effect/risk summary before evaluation and a concise
decision afterward. A requested commit emits one `commit status=committed|failed` event
with VCS, revision, repository, target file, subject, and attribution. Kernel source is
never printed to the live log. The final JSON remains on stdout so callers can parse it
independently of live progress.

`--budget` accepts an optional JSON file that overrides the `--max-*` / `--min-speedup` /
`--max-cv` flags (`{max_rounds, candidates_per_round, max_candidate_seconds,
max_total_seconds, min_speedup, max_cv, benchmark_repetitions}`).

`cases.json` is a list of `{case_id, parameters, weight, protected}` objects. `target.json`
contains `{backend, architecture, device, environment, supported_experiment_kinds}`. The
kind list defaults to `promotable` and `human_review`; targets must opt into each supported
ablation kind. The harness receives the full
`target` dict (including `environment` merged into `os.environ` for the worker) and each
`case` dict verbatim.

The output directory contains:

```text
best_kernel.py
result.json                 # KernelOptimizationResult (success, baseline, final, experiments, stopping_reason)
experiments.json            # alias of result.experiments (Google Doc compatibility)
baseline_profile.json       # aggregated per-case profile for the baseline
best_profile.json           # aggregated per-case profile for the promoted winner
auto_commit.json             # present when --commit-winner reaches finalization
artifacts/profile_traces/   # spilled large profile payloads
experiments/
  baseline/{kernel.py, result.json, profile.json}
  r001-c000/{kernel.py, incremental.patch, cumulative.patch, experiment.json, result.json, profile.json}
  r001-c001/...
```

Every returned candidate source is cached before deduplication, compilation, correctness,
or performance evaluation. `incremental.patch` compares against the exact current-best
parent used to generate that action; `cumulative.patch` compares against the original run
baseline. The live log records the absolute artifact paths and prints the complete incremental
patch between `incremental-diff-begin` and `incremental-diff-end` markers before evaluation.
Failed, duplicate, and rejected candidates keep these artifacts and log entries. If the
provider fails before returning source, the experiment has no patch paths because no candidate
exists to diff.

`--harness-mode` is retained for compatibility
isolation in the CLI path; `StandaloneHarness` is available via the Python API.

## TLX GEMM example

`decision_maker/targets/nvidia/blackwell/gemm/harness.py` runs any complete candidate source that exports
`matmul(a, b)`. It compares against `torch.matmul`, benchmarks with
`triton.testing.do_bench`, and reports latency and TFLOP/s. Its legacy two-argument
`profile(build_artifact, case)` returns latency and throughput, and can optionally collect a
basic Proton trace when `TRITON_PROTON` is set. It does not implement structured profile
requests or NCU collection.

### Target-supplied profiling

Canonical workflow guidance lives in `decision_maker/profiling/docs/proton.md` for Proton
and `decision_maker/profiling/docs/nvidia-ncu.md` for NVIDIA NCU. These documents guide harness and
run orchestration; they are not injected into candidate source prompts.

A target harness may implement `profile(build_artifact, case, request)` to honor structured
profile requests. Missing tools, unsupported metrics, and profiler failures should be returned
as diagnostics so correctness and benchmark results remain usable. Before freezing a CUDA
bundle, smoke-test that an expected Proton main launch has nonzero time and NCU duration is
non-null when those tools are available.

- **Triton Proton launch attribution:** handle `tools=["proton_launch"]` with an absolute
  `artifacts_dir`. A supporting harness should warm up, synchronize, collect one
  launch-attribution-only Proton tree, save raw artifacts, and call
  `parse_proton_launch_attribution()` with the target's exact `main_scope`.
- **Native profiler:** handle `tools=["native_profiler"]` by mapping this portable name to the
  target platform profiler. NVIDIA requests are resolved to NCU. Collect into an `.ncu-rep`,
  then call `export_ncu_report_details()` to persist and parse the details CSV; collection
  stdout contains status messages rather than metric rows when `--export` is used. Explicit
  `ncu` remains a compatible NVIDIA-only request.
- **Diagnostic instrumentation:** `proton_intra_kernel` requires a target-supplied instrumented
  replay. Instrumented source and timing must never be benchmarked, promoted, or committed.

Target-specific `harness.py`/`cases.json`/`target.json` live under
`decision_maker/targets/<vendor>/<arch>/<kernel>/` and are discovered through
`bundle.json`. Pick `--arch` to match the device you are tuning for. GPU knowledge is
selected independently from `optimizer/knowledge/<vendor>/<arch>/`. Pass an existing TLX tutorial such as
`third_party/tlx/tutorials/blackwell_gemm_ws.py` as `--kernel`.

AMD gfx950 GEMM is available under `decision_maker/targets/amd/gfx950/gemm/`. The target
uses the ROCm PyTorch convention `device="cuda:0"` with `backend="hip"` and accepts any
complete candidate source that exports `matmul(a, b)`.

AMD timing uses `rocprofv3 --kernel-trace` device timestamps after a 20-second
steady-state burn. A conservative 3x-IQR filter removes only extreme system-noise samples;
raw traces and samples remain in the profile artifacts. Summary and deep profile requests
also collect supported PMC groups. Deep profiles additionally run `fb_att` for one selected
dispatch of the dominant kernel. Set `TLX_ROCPROFV3` or `TLX_FB_ATT` when those tools are
not on `PATH`.

For an initial AMD smoke run, disable automatic commits and use a small search budget:

```bash
python -m third_party.tlx.tools.agents.kernel_optimization.decision_maker.cli \
  --task authoring \
  --kernel third_party/tlx/tutorials/amd_gemm_warp_pipeline.py \
  --arch gfx950 --target-name gemm \
  --output-dir /tmp/tlx-agent-gfx950 \
  --max-rounds 1 --candidates-per-round 1 \
  --min-speedup 1.05 --no-commit-winner
```

`decision_maker/targets/host/vector_add/harness.py` is a minimal CPU-friendly harness for smoke tests
without a real GPU. Candidate must export `vector_add(a, b)`; on CPU the benchmark uses
synthetic `LATENCY_US` timing so unit tests pass on any host.

## H100 pilot

```bash
# Standalone authoring: arch auto-resolved, or pass --arch hopper for H100
python -m third_party.tlx.tools.agents.kernel_optimization.decision_maker.cli \
  --task authoring \
  --kernel my_gemm_kernel.py --reference-kernel baseline_gemm.py \
  --arch hopper \
  --output-dir /tmp/tlx-agent-h100 \
  --max-rounds 3 --candidates-per-round 4 \
  --max-candidate-seconds 600 --max-total-seconds 3600 \
  --provider codex
```
